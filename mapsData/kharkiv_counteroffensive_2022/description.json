  "description": "Late summer 2022-six months into the brutal Russo-Ukrainian War. The Russian advance toward Sloviansk and Kramatorsk grinds forward, but the offensive is running out of steam. Spread thin across a 1,000-kilometer front, Russian forces are exhausted, critically low on manpower, and struggling to replace their losses with anything but untrained recruits.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukraine has been biding its time-trading land for strength, amassing reserves, and preparing for a decisive strike. Their true plan remains hidden. Russian intelligence, overconfident and blind to the danger, dismisses Kharkiv as a secondary front. But they are about to be proven disastrously wrong.\n\nThe Ukrainian counteroffensive is set to strike with overwhelming force, aiming not just to push the Russians back, but to shatter their entire defensive line. Can Ukraine turn a breakthrough into a full-scale rout? Can they collapse the Kharkiv and Luhansk fronts before the Russians can regroup? The fate of the war hangs in the balance."
