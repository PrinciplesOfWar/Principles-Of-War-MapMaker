  "description": "World War II enters its most brutal chapter. In the largest military invasion in history, millions of Axis troops surge across an almost 3,000-kilometer front, striking deep into the Soviet Union. The USSR's vast resources are to be plundered to secure Germany's total dominance in Europe and beyond, while entire populations are condemned to extermination or enslavement.\n\nThe German Blitzkrieg leaves entire armies encircled or annihilated in massive operational traps, unable to react to the sheer speed and precision of the Wehrmacht's advance. Stalin's war machine, along with the vast Soviet industrial might and its people, is caught unprepared and teeters on the brink of collapse.\n\nBut the Germans severely underestimated the Soviet Union's strength, the size of its reserves, the sheer scale of the distances involved, and the enormous logistical challenges of such an invasion. It is here that the Wehrmacht is pushed to its limits in this war of annihilation. Can they deliver the knockout blow before winter sets in?"
