  "description": "Arena, a fictional mirrored battlefield, is designed for short yet intense skirmishes. Its compact layout forces rapid engagements while still preserving the full depth of gameplay. With no place to hide and little room for error, every move matters. Victory is swift, but so is defeat-can you outmaneuver your opponent before they do the same to you?"
